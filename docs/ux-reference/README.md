# UX Reference Screenshots

Use this folder to keep visual references that future sessions can reuse without hunting through chat history.

## Folder Structure

- `docs/ux-reference/current-app/`: screenshots of the current app and current flow pain points
- `docs/ux-reference/next-app/`: inspiration images, mockups, and target visual direction

## Suggested File Naming

Use a date-first format so screenshots sort chronologically:

- `YYYY-MM-DD-journal-main.png`
- `YYYY-MM-DD-session-select.png`
- `YYYY-MM-DD-game-entry-frame-7.png`

Example:

- `2026-02-12-journal-main.png`

## Capture Guidance

For current-flow screenshots, include these views when possible:

1. Journal main screen
2. League/session selection flow
3. In-progress game entry screen (mid-frame)
4. Any screen that feels slow, cluttered, or hard to use one-handed

## Annotation Tip

If a screenshot has a specific problem to solve, add a sibling markdown note with the same base name.

Example:

- `2026-02-12-game-entry-frame-7.png`
- `2026-02-12-game-entry-frame-7.md`

In the note, include:

- what you were trying to do
- what felt difficult
- what you wish happened instead
